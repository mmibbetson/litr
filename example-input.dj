# Title Here

This is an example document that can be tangled. Here's the first code block:

{% tangle hello.zig ``` 2 %}
``` =zig
pub fn main() !void {
  std.debug.print("Hello, world!", .{});
}
```
{% tangle end %}

The block above will be output into the tangled source code *after* the next block.

{% tangle hello.zig ``` 1 %}
``` =zig
const std = @import("std");
```
{% tangle end %}

If two blocks are declared with the same position, `litr` should print an error explaining this conflict.
